* <b>Satyanweshi, the truth-seeking chatbot</b> <i>(https://www.satyanweshi.net/)</i> <br> 
<i>Mentor: Prof. Swaprava Nath, Prof. Hamim Zafar, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.</i><br>
	*	The chatbot checks fake information spread over the web using NLP. Apart from fact-checking, it also provides general
information regarding COVID-19 from prominent knowledge sources like WHO, CDC and National Health websites. The
knowledge-base is continuously updated by scraping multiple relevant websites. Transformer models like BERT, T5 have
been used to understand the query of the user and provide an appropriate and detailed answer.<br>
	*	Our solution secured the second place in MHRD AICTE SAMADHAN competition in response to COVID-19 among
more than 2500 participants. Working in collaboration with InfoPost - a startup based out of San Diego, California.<br>
