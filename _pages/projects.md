* <b>Satyanweshi, the truth-seeking chatbot</b> (<a https://www.satyanweshi.net/ ="url">satyanweshi.net</a>) <br> 
<i>Mentor: Prof. Swaprava Nath, Prof. Hamim Zafar, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i><br>
	*	The chatbot checks fake information spread over the web using NLP. Apart from fact-checking, it also provides general
information regarding COVID-19 from prominent knowledge sources like WHO, CDC and National Health websites. The
knowledge-base is continuously updated by scraping multiple relevant websites. Transformer models like BERT, T5 have
been used to understand the query of the user and provide an appropriate and detailed answer.<br>
	*	Our solution secured the second place in MHRD AICTE SAMADHAN competition in response to COVID-19 among
more than 2500 participants. Working in collaboration with InfoPost - a startup based out of San Diego, California.<br>

* <b>Real Time Location Prediction Using Bluetooth Low Energy Devices</b> <br>
<i>Mentor: Prof. A.R. Harish, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i><br>
	*	Track the position of a moving tag by combining highly unreliable and noisy BLE observations streaming from multiple
locations using several gateways with the help of Advanced LANDMARC with adaptive k-nearest algorithm for
RFID location system and neural network. Studied the radiation pattern of BLE devices and contour of BLE gateways.<br>

* <b>Web Scraping for News Articles</b> <br>
<i>Mentor: Prof. Swaprava Nath, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur </i><br>
	*	This project was done as a part of project track (offered to students with strong programming background) in the course
ESC101 (Fundamentals of Computing). Headlines scraped from prominent news websites like BBC World, NDTV,
India Today have been analysed and the user comes to know what is trending at that moment.<br>
